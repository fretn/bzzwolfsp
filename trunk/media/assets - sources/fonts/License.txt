This was primary meant for wolfX project but works just as fine for COOP. 

Note that font is rendered for "rtcw"'s way of dealing with font.
If you want to port this to ET you'll need to edit *.dat file and 
simply rename fontImage to name you wish to use - that is 
if you're planning to add it as a new font...
