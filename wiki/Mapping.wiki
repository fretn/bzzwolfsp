= Introduction =

New entities for mappers and other information for mappers.


= Details =

== Conditional sections ==

The .ents, .ai and .script file support #if #else and #endif for cvar conditions, example below.

== New entities ==
  * coop_spawnpoint: this entity is the initial spawn point for coop games, you can place multiple if you want, you can disable spawnpoints by setting their spawnflags to 0.
 * coop_spawnpoint_trigger: this entity is a trigger which enables spawnpoints. The spawnpoints must be linked to it by setting their targetname the same as the classname of this trigger. Set spawnflags of these spawnpoints to 0 so they are not initial spawnpoints.
 * target_location: just like in the multiplayer, this entity is now supported. If you add a 'targetname' field to it which is linked to a 'target' of a coop_spawnpoint_trigger, then this location name is used in the centerprint text when a spawnzone is captured

== Ents file support ==
 If you want to modify existing maps, you can make a file: mapname.ents (in the maps folder), here you can place entity data

 example: tram.ents

== .ai scripts ==
 In a coop game, the following attributes are ignored: aim_accuracy, aim_skill, attack_skill and health
 these are set based on the value of g_gameskill
Also the script must be named mapname.coop.ai (single player uses mapname.ai)
the same counts for the mapname.coop.script file
