= Introduction =

New entities for mappers and other information for mappers.


= Details =

== New entities ==
  * info_player_coop: this entity is the initial spawn point for coop games, you can place multiple if you want
  * target_location: just like in the multiplayer, this entity is now supported.

== Ents file support ==
 If you want to modify existing maps, you can make a file: mapname.ents (in the maps folder), here you can place entity data

 example: tram.ents
{{{
{
"classname" "target_location"
"origin" "2637 -16 920"
"message" "Tram entrance"
}

{
"classname" "info_player_coop"
"origin" "3826 1997 1272"
"angle" "-88"
}
}}}

== .ai scripts ==
 In a coop game, the following attributes are ignored: aim_accuracy, aim_skill, attack_skill and health
 these are set based on the value of g_gameskill
Also the script must be named mapname.coop.ai (single player uses mapname.ai)
the same counts for the mapname.coop.script file
