= Introduction =

New entities for mappers and other information for mappers.


= Details =

== New entities ==
  * coop_spawnpoint: this entity is the initial spawn point for coop games, you can place multiple if you want, you can disable spawnpoints by setting their spawnflags to 0. Also you can connect flagpoles to spawnpoints by setting the flagpole's target the same as the targetname of a spawnpoint, touching the flagpole will enable all these spawnpoints and disable the others
  * target_location: just like in the multiplayer, this entity is now supported.

== Ents file support ==
 If you want to modify existing maps, you can make a file: mapname.ents (in the maps folder), here you can place entity data

 example: tram.ents
{{{
{
"classname" "target_location"
"origin" "2637 -16 920"
"message" "Tram entrance"
}

{
"classname" "coop_spawnpoint"
"origin" "3826 1997 1272"
"angle" "-88"
"spawnflags" "1"
// spawnflags 1 means enabled
}
}}}

== .ai scripts ==
 In a coop game, the following attributes are ignored: aim_accuracy, aim_skill, attack_skill and health
 these are set based on the value of g_gameskill
Also the script must be named mapname.coop.ai (single player uses mapname.ai)
the same counts for the mapname.coop.script file
