= Introduction =

computer 1: start game with /coopmap *mapname*

computer 2: type /connect *ip*, once you see the introduction screen type /playerstart

Don't join the game while a camera is running :) (I'm working on this)

Use a dedicated server or strange things will happen.
Starting a game on windows doesn't work, I'm looking on this, so basicly the server needs to be an OS X or linux machine
