= Introduction =

(don't forget to put your pk3 files into your main folder)

computer 1: start game with /coopmap *mapname*

computer 2: type /connect *ip*, once you see the introduction screen type /playerstart

On windows you have to connect to the ip 127.0.0.1 if you want to connect to a local server.
On Mac OS X its 0.0.0.0 that you need to connect to.

= Details =

If you want to enable cheats, use /coopdevmap

Don't join the game while a camera is running :) (I'm working on this)

Use a dedicated server or strange things will happen.

Starting a game on windows doesn't work, I'm looking on this, so basicly the server needs to be an OS X or linux machine

= Starting a dedicated server under Mac OS X = 

Open Terminal.app and switch to your RTCW installation folder

type: ./wolfsp.app/Contents/MacOS/wolfspded.ub +coopmap tram

= Console =

use shift-escape to open the console

= PK3 Files =

Copy all your wolfenstein pk3 files to the main folder of this game.
Also copy our pk3 files (you can find them in other_files in the svn) to that same main folder.

= Cvars =

== g_autospawn ==
g_autospawn 1 autosaves you spawnpoint every 30 seconds, if g_autospawn is set to 0 then you can
save your spawn point with the command: setcoopspawnpoint, bind x setcoopspawnpoint to assign it to
a button

== g_skipcutscenes ==
set to 1 if you want to skip the cutscenes

= Cmds =
+dropweapon drop your current weapon so your coop friend can pick it up

dropammo drop your current ammo clip 

= ents file support =

if you put a file in the maps folder with the name: mapname.ents then this file will be loaded and all the entities will be spawned into the map.

example: escape2.ents

{
"skin" "zombie/boss2"
"classname" "ai_zombie"
"angle" "240"
"origin" "-1084 604 -260"
"ainame" "nazi1337"
"spawnflags" "0" 
"targetname" "nazi1337"
"head" "escape3"
}

this will spawn a zombie in the map and it will attack the german soldiers.
