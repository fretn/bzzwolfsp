= Introduction =

(don't forget to put your pk3 files into your main folder)

computer 1: start game with /coopmap *mapname*

computer 2: type /connect *ip*, once you see the introduction screen type /playerstart

On windows you have to connect to the ip 127.0.0.1 if you want to connect to a local server.
On Mac OS X its 0.0.0.0 that you need to connect to.

= Details =

If you want to enable cheats, use /coopdevmap

Don't join the game while a camera is running :) (I'm working on this)

Use a dedicated server or strange things will happen.
Starting a game on windows doesn't work, I'm looking on this, so basicly the server needs to be an OS X or linux machine

= Starting a dedicated server under Mac OS X = 

Open Terminal.app and switch to your RTCW installation folder

type: ./wolfsp.app/Contents/MacOS/wolfspded.ub +coopmap tram

= Console =

use shift-escape to open the console
