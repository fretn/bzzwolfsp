= Introduction =

Put all the rtcw pk3 files in the main folder.
Put the pk3 files found in the other_files dir (see svn) also into the main folder.

You can start a server through the menus.
Or by using the console:

computer 1: start game with /coopmap *mapname*

computer 2: type /connect *ip*, once you see the introduction screen type /playerstart, or press the arrow 
on the bottom right corner.

On windows you have to connect to the ip 127.0.0.1 if you want to connect to a local server.
On Mac OS X its 0.0.0.0 that you need to connect to.

= Console =

use shift-escape to open the console

= PK3 Files =

Copy all your wolfenstein pk3 files to the main folder of this game.
Also copy our pk3 files (you can find them in other_files in the svn) to that same main folder.

= Cvars =

== g_autospawn ==
 g_autospawn 1 autosaves you spawnpoint every 30 seconds, if g_autospawn is set to 0 then you can
 save your spawn point with the command: setcoopspawnpoint, bind x setcoopspawnpoint to assign it to  a button

== g_skipcutscenes ==
 set to 1 if you want to skip the cutscenes

== cg_drawteamoverlay ==
 Set to 1 to see playerweapon, playername and health

 Set to 2 to see playerweapon, playername, location and health

 The playerweapon is just one character, K (knife), P (pistol), S (submachinegun), E (explosive), R (rifle), H (heavy weapon). 

 See screenshot below:

== g_gameskill ==
 In a coop game the aim_accuracy and health of the aicast is raised by raising g_gameskill ( 0 - 2 ).
 In single player these are set in the mapname.ai script files for each aicast, the coop mode ignores these  values in the scripts.

= Cmds =
==+dropweapon==
 drop your current weapon so your coop friend can pick it up

==dropammo==
 drop your current ammo clip 

==dumploc==
 dumploc <location name>

 writes the target_location entity data to a .loc file in the main folder, copy the text to the .ents file to use the target_location in the game

==playerstart==
 Use this if you are stuck at the loading screen. (Happens when you connect to a non dedicated server)

==coopmap==
 Starts a coop game

==coopdevmap==
 starts a coop game with cheats enabled

==setcoopspawnpoint==
 sets current location as the next spawnpoint. Only works if g_autospawn is disabled on the server

==dumpaicast==
 dumpaicast classname ainame

 where classname is one of these: 

{{{
ai_soldier ai_american ai_zombie ai_warzombie ai_venom ai_loper ai_boss_helga ai_boss_heinrich ai_eliteguard ai_stimsoldier_dual ai_stimsoldier_rocket ai_stimsoldier_tesla ai_supersoldier ai_protosoldier ai_frogman ai_blackguard ai_partisan ai_civilian
}}}

 this writes for example an ai_soldier entity to a file mapname.ents, copy the text from this file to mapname.ents to spawn a new aicast entity into the map, you can also script this new ai in the mapname.ai file

==dumpcoopspawnpoint==
 This dumps a info_player_coop entity to the mapname.ents file
 This entity is used as a spawnpoint for coop games. If there are multiple of this one, a random entity is chosen. Make sure if a player spawns on this place he triggers the ai scripts when he starts walking

= ents file support =

if you put a file in the maps folder with the name: mapname.ents then this file will be loaded and all the entities will be spawned into the map.

example: escape2.ents
{{{
{
"skin" "zombie/boss2"
"classname" "ai_zombie"
"angle" "240"
"origin" "-1084 604 -260"
"ainame" "nazi1337"
"spawnflags" "0" 
"targetname" "nazi1337"
"head" "escape3"
}
}}}
this will spawn a zombie in the map and it will attack the german soldiers.

You can also make target_location entities so a location shows up in the coopoverlay on the HUD:
this is an example for the map tram
{{{
{
"classname" "target_location"
"message" "Allied Spawn"
"origin" "3292 1940 960"
}
{
"classname" "target_location"
"message" "Generator"
"origin" "3408 -240 984"
}
{
"classname" "target_location"
"message" "Tram entrance"
"origin" "2576 208 1096"
}
}}}
